<h1>Problem Statement:Write how will you represent a Linked List in a Graphical View</h1>
<h2>Author : Rutvika Wagh</h2>
<h3>********Explanation********</h3>
<h3>To represent a Linked List in a graphical view:</h3>
 <h4> <h3>1)Nodes representation as boxes:</h3>Each Node in a Linked List can be represented as a box or a rectangle.Inside each box we can include the data contained in that box.We can also have pointers representing to previous and next Node where next can be used in both Singly as well as doubly linked list and previous can be used in doubly linked list.
   <br><br>
   
   <h3>2)Arrows as Pointers:</h3> To visualize the connections between nodes, we can use arrows. These arrows represent the "next" or "previous" pointers in a linked list. An arrow from one node's box to another indicates the direction of traversal in the list.
   <br>
   <h3>3)Head and Tail Markers:</h3> We can add markers to indicate the head and tail of the list. The head marker points to the first node, and the tail marker points to the last node (in the case of a doubly linked list).<br>
  <h3> 4)NULL:</h3> To show the end of the list, we can represent a null reference (end of the list) with a simple "NULL" indicator. This indicates that there are no more nodes to traverse.
   <br>
   <h3>5)Circular Linked Lists:</h3> For circular linked lists, we can illustrate the circular nature by showing arrows that loop back to the beginning of the list.
